This is intended to facilitates implementation of the IG by provide a common starting point for interoperability.  The Visit types can be extended by implementers to meet there use cases.  In order to align with the FHIR Appointment, Schedule and Slot resources, these concepts are mapped to the Argonaut Appointment Types and Argonaut Scheduling Services Valuesets which are Snomed Concepts.</p>
